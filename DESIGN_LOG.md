# Psion Chronicles — Design Log

Plain-English record of the design decisions behind the companion app, and *why* each one was
made. The rules themselves live in `GAME_RULES.md`; the code is under `app/`. This file is the
"why" — the reasoning and the choices made along the way — so the intent isn't lost.

> Companion app for **Psion Chronicles**, a homebrew TTRPG (built with Luke). Vanilla JS, no build
> step; runs from a single HTML file or any static host. Characters save to the browser's
> localStorage (per-device).

## How the pieces fit (one look)
- `app/data.js` — all game data on `window.PC` (backgrounds, heritages, kinetics, skills, weapon
  types, 360 techniques, fighting styles/combat skills, flaws).
- `app/items.js` — the ~194-item weapon/gear catalog.
- `app/rules.js` — pure math: modifiers, pools, derived stats, chakra effects, proficiency.
- `app/app.js` — character creator, roster, level-up screen (`window.PsionApp`).
- `app/play.js` — the live play sheet (`window.PsionPlay`): Sheet · Combat · Limbs · Kinetics ·
  Skills · Traits · Description · Inventory.
- `app/styles.css` — the "Post-Veil" dark theme.

## Decision log (in the order we built things)

### 1. Chakra lockout now covers techniques and weapon attacks
**Decision.** When an attribute's chakra reaches 4 hits (locked out), it disables not just that
attribute's *skills* but also its *Kinetic techniques* and *weapon attacks*.
**Why.** A full lockout was only greying out skills; techniques and attacks tied to that attribute
were still usable, which contradicted the "locked out" idea.
**How.** The lockout applies immediately, on the next roll, and is scoped to the affected attribute
only (other attributes stay usable). Locked buttons are disabled with a reason tooltip.

### 2. Marksmanship = a called-shot bonus action
**Decision.** After a ranged attack (weapon **or** technique), before rolling damage, you may spend
your **Bonus Action** to aim a called shot at a limb. Roll a skill check; the GM sets the DC by the
target's size/difficulty. On a success, the attack's damage lands on the chosen limb.
**Choice made.** The check modifier = **the attack's attribute + proficiency** (not a fixed stat),
so a rifle shot uses the weapon's attribute and a Kinetic bolt uses the technique's attribute.
**How.** Because the app can't know which attack you just made, the card gives a source picker
(your equipped weapons + your single-target attack techniques); it spends only the Bonus slot.

### 3. Heritage widens your starting-gear options
**Decision.** Your Regional Heritage's Fighting Style flavors what you can **start** with, on top of
your background's weapon proficiency.
**Choices made.**
- Heritage-opened weapons are **start-only, NOT proficient** (you begin with them, but without the
  proficiency bonus — that's a "solve later" gap we accepted for now).
- A **ranged-focused** heritage opens **all** ranged weapon types as starting options (pick one that
  complements your attributes, or not — your call).
- A **two-weapon-fighting** heritage (Oceania's *Twin Fang*) offers a choice: **one two-handed weapon
  OR two one-handed weapons**.
- The weapon-focus map is defined for **all 8** fighting styles.
**Why equipment is the last creation step.** So Heritage (and any bonus proficiency it grants) is
already chosen when the gear options are built.

### 4. Soul Pool on the character sheet
**Decision.** The Sheet tab shows a **Soul Pool** alongside HP (Body) and KP (Mind): your Soul Level
and XP, with a **Level Up** button right beneath it.
**Why it's a tracker, not a progress bar.** Leveling is **GM-driven** and the XP-per-level thresholds
are still being tuned, so we deliberately avoided a fake "progress to next level" bar. It's an
editable XP + level display instead — no invented numbers. (Easy to turn into a real XP-to-next bar
once thresholds are set.)

### 5. Kinetics chosen via tabs, ordered by relevance
**Decision.** On both character creation and level-up, the 18 Kinetics are **tabs** — tap one to see
just that school's techniques, instead of scrolling one long wall.
**Ordering (matches how Combat Skills surface your Fighting Style first):**
1. your **proficient focus** Kinetic first (★),
2. then any Kinetic you already **have techniques in** (✦),
3. then the rest **in attribute order** (STR → AGI → CON → INT → WIS → CHA).

### 6. Negative traits (flaws) — one per background, one per heritage
**Decision.** Every background and every heritage carries a flaw, so no choice is all-upside. Flaws
are "flavor with a light bite," never build-breaking.
**Background flaws = whole-attribute.** Disadvantage on one attribute's skill checks and Kinetic
technique attacks — always a stat the archetype *doesn't* lean on (e.g. Body Builder → INT). Flaws do
**not** touch weapon attacks or initiative.
**Heritage flaws = narrow / situational.** Disadvantage on **one specific skill** (e.g. North America →
Etiquette).
**Why the two are different — the key balance call.** Heritage is chosen independently of background.
If heritage flaws were also whole-attribute, many background+heritage combos would drop the flaw onto
the character's **primary** stat and feel punishing. Keeping heritage flaws to a single narrow skill
guarantees no combination can gut a build. (We considered whole-attribute and purely-roleplay options
and deliberately chose narrow/situational.)
**How.** Skills under a flaw are tagged ⚠ on the Skills tab; both flaws and the heritage's positive
traits are collected on a dedicated **Traits** tab; they apply automatically on the relevant rolls.

### 7. Kinetic proficiency & expertise by completing tiers
**Decision.** Master a Kinetic and it rewards you:
- Learn **every** technique in a Kinetic's **Adept** tier (all 5) → **auto-gain proficiency** in that
  Kinetic (matters for Kinetics outside your background focus, which is proficient from the start).
- Learn **every** technique in its **Expert** tier (all 5) → **auto-gain expertise** = **double** your
  proficiency bonus on that Kinetic's technique attack rolls.
**Choice made.** Expertise applies to **all** of that Kinetic's technique attacks, not just the
higher-tier ones (so a completed lower-tier attack benefits too).
**How.** It's derived automatically from the techniques you know — no separate bookkeeping. Status and
progress show on the play sheet's **Kinetics** tab, and the level-up screen toasts the moment you
cross a threshold.

### 8. Saving & access — GitHub Pages (public), with git as the backup
**Decision.** The project lives in a public GitHub repo — **`stbkat-ai/psion-chronicles`** — and is served
live via **GitHub Pages** at **https://stbkat-ai.github.io/psion-chronicles/**. A `git push` auto-deploys.
**Why we moved here.** We first published the app + this log as **private Claude Artifacts**. They worked,
but a private artifact is locked to the exact Claude account that created it (here the sanctuary's
`tracy@` Teams account). On other devices the browser/app defaulted to a *different* account, so the links
404'd and the phone couldn't open them — and the Claude phone *app* has no artifact gallery at all. A plain
**public URL needs no login and works in any browser on any device**, which is what "open it on my phone"
actually requires. The homebrew game content isn't sensitive, so public is an easy trade. The private
artifacts still exist as a legacy copy; GitHub Pages is the canonical front door.
**Backup.** The full source **and 26+ commits of history** now live on GitHub (off-machine), not just on
the one PC. `build_bundle.py` still produces a single-file build for anyone who wants to drop it on another
host.
**Known limitation — data doesn't sync.** Characters live in each device's own browser storage, so a
character made on the PC won't appear on the phone (and vice-versa). Real cross-device sync (a small
backend + login) is a **deferred, future feature** — noted, not yet built.

### 9. Character Description — appearance / basic info (flavor)
**Decision.** Added a **Description** step to the character creator (placed right before Review) and a
matching **Description** tab on the play sheet (between Traits and Inventory). It captures purely
descriptive details — **Basics** (age, gender, pronouns), **Physical appearance** (height, weight, skin
tone, hair colour, hair style, eye colour), and a free-text **Distinguishing features** box (tattoos,
piercings, scars, etc.). Everything the player enters at creation shows up on the play sheet's Description
tab, where it's also editable at the table (fields save on blur, like Inventory item fields).
**Why.** Players wanted a home for who their character *is* beyond the numbers, so the table can picture
them. It's flavor only — **no rules effect** — so it never gates the mechanical creation flow: the step
sits at the end and every field is optional (Next is always enabled). We put it before Review so the
finished sheet summarises it, and gave it its own play tab (rather than burying it in Notes) so it reads
like a reference card.
**How it's wired.** The field schema is defined **once** in `app.js` (`DESCRIPTION_GROUPS` +
`DESCRIPTION_MISC`) and exposed on `window.PsionApp` so `play.js` renders the exact same fields — one
source of truth, no drift. `defaultDescription()` seeds new characters; existing characters are backfilled
with blank fields on edit (`app.js`) and on open (`ensurePlay` in `play.js`), so nothing breaks for
characters made before this existed. User-entered text is HTML-escaped in the Review summary.

### 10. Beginner weapons — trim the starting-gear picker
**Decision.** Starting gear no longer offers **every** Common weapon of an offered type. Instead there's a
curated **beginner** shortlist — **up to two weapons per weapon _subtype_** (the simplest/most iconic of each) —
and only those are selectable at character creation. The list lives in `app/items.js` as `PC.STARTER_WEAPONS`
(a plain, commented array of names — the single source of truth), and `eligibleStartWeapons()` in `app.js`
filters against it.
**Why.** The Common list had grown large (e.g. 15 Heavy Weapons), so the creator's starting-weapon dropdown was
a wall of near-identical options. Two per subtype keeps it short while still representing every subtype, so no
playstyle loses its flavor. We kept it a **separate list** (the user's call) so the whole starting roster can be
seen and tuned in one place, and picked **two** per subtype (not one) so there's still a little choice.
**What did NOT change.** This is one new filter layered on top — **every other starting-gear rule is intact**:
you still may only start with a weapon whose **type you're proficient with** (or one your Heritage's Fighting
Style opens as *start-only*, tagged "not proficient"), bonus weapon-proficiency grants still widen the options,
and two-weapon Heritages still choose one 2H or two 1H weapons. The full catalog is still available in play; only
*creation* is restricted. A safety fallback keeps the old all-Common behavior if the list is ever missing, so the
picker can't end up empty.

### 11. Starting-weapon picker groups by subtype (as well as type)
**Decision.** The creator's starting-weapon dropdown now shows a separate group **per weapon _subtype_**, each
labelled **"Type · Subtype"** (e.g. *Heavy Weapons · Great Swords*, *Heavy Weapons · Great Axes*), instead of one
group per type. To make this possible, the beginner list in `items.js` changed shape: `PC.STARTER_WEAPONS` became
a nested map **`PC.STARTER_WEAPONS_BY_SUBTYPE`** (type → subtype → names); the flat list and a new
`PC.starterSubtype(name)` lookup are **derived** from it, so there's still one source of truth.
**Why.** With beginner weapons trimmed to ~2 per subtype, players couldn't tell *which* subtype each option was —
grouping by subtype makes the shortlist self-documenting and easier to scan.
**Why "Type · Subtype" labels (not nested groups).** A native HTML `<select>` can't nest `<optgroup>`s, so a true
type→subtype tree isn't possible in the dropdown. Combining both into each group's label is the standard way to
show the hierarchy while keeping the plain, reliable native control. Group order follows the map (proficient types
first, then Heritage start-only types, tagged "not proficient").

### 12. Attribute-buff techniques now raise the matching pool (bug fix)
**Decision.** A sustained technique that raises attributes now also raises the matching **pool** (max HP/KP) for as
long as it's active — body-attribute buffs (STR/AGI/CON) grow **max HP**, mind-attribute buffs (INT/WIS/CHA) grow
**max KP**, by exactly the buff. (Reported via *Ki Flame*: it buffed the three body attributes but max HP wasn't
moving; now its +2/+2/+2 adds +6 max HP while active.)
**Why it was broken.** Each pool is the *sum of its attribute scores*, but `maxHP()`/`maxKP()` in `play.js` computed
that sum from **buff-free** scores (they passed `null` for temp modifiers), while everything else — modifiers,
Defense, movement — used the buffed `liveScores()`. So the pools were the one derived value ignoring active buffs.
**The fix.** `maxHP()`/`maxKP()` now use `liveScores()` (buff-aware); a separate `permMaxHP()`/`permMaxKP()` keeps the
buff-free value used only to seed a fresh play session. `ensurePlay` clamps current HP/KP to the buff-aware max.
**Design choice — a full bar stays full; a partial bar gains headroom.** Activating an attribute buff raises the
*max*. If the bar was **full** at that moment, current rises with it (stays full); if it was **partial**, current
stays put and you gain headroom to heal into. When the buff ends the max drops and current clamps back down — so
toggling on/off can never net free HP/KP (you can only ever *stay* full, never gain above your unbuffed full).
*(This first shipped as headroom-only even when full; per the user, a full bar should top up to the new max — done
in `toggleSustained`, which captures the pre-activation maxes and, if a bar was still full after paying costs,
raises it to the new max.)* Limb HP (a fraction of max HP) scales with the buffed max as a consequence, consistent.

### 13. Pool bars labelled "Body Pool / Mind Pool", code inside the bar
**Decision.** On the play sheet's Sheet tab, the two pool bars now read **"Body Pool"** and **"Mind Pool"**
above the bar (with current/max on the right, as before), and the short code **HP** / **KP** is drawn *inside*
the bar in small black print. Previously the header just said "HP"/"KP".
**Why.** The user wanted the fuller pool names visible and the short codes moved into the bars — a cleaner,
more consistent look that also ties the bars to the game's "Body Pool = HP / Mind Pool = KP" language.
**How.** `bar()` in `play.js` now takes a `name` (shown above) and a `letter` (overlaid inside via a
`.bar-letter` span); the pool-bar track is slightly taller (`.poolbar .bar-track`) to seat the code, which is
centered, bold, black, with a faint light text-shadow so it stays legible whether it sits over the coloured
fill or the darker empty portion. Limb and carry bars are untouched (the rules are scoped to `.poolbar`).

## Deferred / future ideas
- **Cross-device character sync** (backend + simple login) — the big one.
- **Export / Import** characters to a JSON file (a simpler manual bridge / backup) if we want it before
  full sync.
- Heritage-opened starting weapons granting **actual proficiency** (currently start-only).
- A real **XP-to-next-level** bar once Luke sets the thresholds.
- Off-PC backup of the **source** — ✅ done (public GitHub repo `stbkat-ai/psion-chronicles`).

*Standing rule (recorded in `CLAUDE.md`): this log is updated as part of every feature change — a new
entry or revision here, the matching `GAME_RULES.md`/`README.md` sections, and a `git push` (which
auto-deploys GitHub Pages) — automatically, without needing to be asked.*
